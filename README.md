# Data_Visualization
I have taken a dataset from kaggle and it is named "train.csv".
The dataset was transformed by Power Query Editor and loaded into Power BI.
Then, different columns were represented through different visualizing charts.
A "Drill Down" can be used in the "Number of Orders by Product" Visualization.
The dashboard is uploaded here and it is named "Superstore Sales Dashboard".
You can download it and view it. Screenshots are also available.
